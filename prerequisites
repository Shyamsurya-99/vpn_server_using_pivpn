1)I recommend using the Raspberry Pi 4 with 2GB of RAM for this tutorial. However, it can be challenging to find these Raspberry Pi devices. You can check where to purchase them on the official Raspberry Pi website: [insert URL here].

2)For storage, I suggest using a 32GB class 10 microSD card. You can find one like this: [insert URL here]. Additionally, you will need a microSD card reader to initially set up the Raspberry Pi OS.

3)Having a keyboard and monitor connected to the Raspberry Pi is optional for this tutorial.

4)Since our project is for wireless connection oriented we are going to have a router for port forwarding.
